- Build robust backend systems with **GoLang** for blockchain interactions and CLI tools.
- Implement high-performance cryptographic solutions in **Rust** for enhanced security.
- Create trading algorithms and DeFi applications for real-time crypto markets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Solidity, GoLang, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Sui, Starknet
- **Tools**: Hardhat, Truffle, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Chainlink, IPFS, Docker, Git
- **Security**: FHE, AES, RSA, Ring Signatures

## 🌟 Key Projects
- **FHE Multi-Signature Token System**: ERC20 token system with Zama’s TFHE for encrypted transfers and Safe wallets.
- **Bellman zkSNARK Circuit**: Rust-based ZKP circuit for private multiplication constraints.
- **Certicryp**: Built a decentralized certificate management system using Soulbound ERC721 tokens on Polygon
- **Cross-Chain Escrow Scheduler**: Created a Go CLI tool for cross-chain asset locking and scheduling using Espresso Systems.
- **Ring Signatures in Rust**: Implemented RSA ring signatures for private, untraceable transactions, demonstrating advanced cryptography skills.

## 💼 Internships
- **Nethermind (2024)**: Enhanced Starknet's block explorer Voyager and P2P networking in Juno, improving transaction visibility and node communication efficiency.
- **Tabibi Healthcare Solutions (2023-2024)**: Developed a beta healthcare ecosystem integrating doctors, patients, and pharmacies with robust APIs.
- **SimplyFi InfoTech Solutions (2023)**: Created a multichain crypto wallet with send, receive, and swap features, integrated with GraphQL and secure key derivation.

## 🏆 Highlights
- Winner at **ETHBangkok** and 5+ blockchain hackathons, networking with industry leaders at **DevCon** and **Pragma Bangkok**.
